\section{Introduction}




\section{Background}

Why it's appealing. Planarity allows for easy polygonal spatial analysis \citep{fohl_non-planar_1996}. In mathematics, there is an exact bijection between planar graphs and trees, and classifying planar graphs presents a trivial computational problem \citep{louf_typology_2014}. Planar graphs offer computational simplicity and tractability. But \citet{masucci_random_2009} and \citet{masucci_limited_2013} argue that planar graphs have also presented a compelling research domain for urban scholars and geographers as they were understudied until recently because they appear topologically and geometrically trivial and the planarity constraint did not lend itself to certain popular graph-theoretic analyses. By contrast, \citet[p.~3]{barthelemy_spatial_2011} argue that \enquote{planar spatial networks are the most important and most studies have focused on these examples}. As \citet[p.~1]{viana_simplicity_2013} put it, \enquote{there is still a lack of global, high-level metrics allowing to characterize their structure and geometrical patterns.}

Street networks, however, are frequently nonplanar in reality: they tend to have some overpasses or underpasses that result in the failure of formal proofs of their planarity, such as the \citet{kuratowski_sur_1930} theorem or the \cite{hopcroft_efficient_1974} algorithm \citep{gastner_spatial_2006}. As \citet[p.~7]{levinson_network_2012} points out, \enquote{Real networks are neither perfect, nor planar, nor grids, though they may approximate them.} \enquote{Quite often the transportation network has overpasses and underpasses that require a non-planar network representation} \citet[p.~199]{jiang_object-oriented_2010}. \enquote{A planar graph is one which can be drawn in two dimensions with no edges intersecting except at vertices on which they are both incident. For many infrastructure networks, this is approximately true, although bridges and tunnels in ground-transport networks are an obvious (but generally minor) exception.} \citet[p.~1258]{fischer_spatial_2014}.

Twenty years ago, \citep[p.~18]{fohl_non-planar_1996} claimed, \enquote{The most commonly used data model for transportation networks is the fully intersected, planar data model} and called for a nonplanar model to better represent truly nonplanar spatial networks.

\enquote{The planar network data model has received widespread acceptance and use. Despite its popularity, the
model has limitations for some areas of transportation analysis, especially where complex network structures
are involved. One major problem is caused by the planar embedding requirement... intersections at grade cannot be distinguished from intersections with an overpass or underpass that do not cross at grade.} \citep[p.~395]{fischer_gis_2004}

\citet[p.~6]{kwan_review_1996} \enquote{the difficulty in accurately representing overpasses or underpasses may lead to problems when running various routing algorithms (e.g. recommending that a traveler make a left-turn at an intersection that proves to be an overpass!)}.

\section{Discussion}

The point: street networks are regularly nonplanar in the formal sense. They are embedded in three dimensions and have a z-value along with their x and y. Because they are mostly planar, typically with only a few overpasses or underpasses, they could often be described accurately as \emph{quasi-planar}. However, claiming that urban street networks broadly are planar misrepresents them in several ways.

1. Forces false nodes where grade-separated edges cross.

2. Accordingly, underestimates average edge length (a proxy for street segment lengths and block sizes)

3. Misrepresents connectivity for routing, accessibility analysis, and other connectivity studies
